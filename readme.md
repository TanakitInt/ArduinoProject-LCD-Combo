# Arduino - LCD Status
Messure a temperature and brightness at the moment at once then display on the LCD panel.

Since the HD44780 support KATAKANA character.<br/>
I've added Japanese to the project too.

## Components used :
x1 Breadboard  
x1 Arduino Mega (China Model)  
x1 USB-B Cable  
A lot of WIRE (how to connect without them?)  

x1 HD44780 [2x16] LCD panel with build-in I2C  
x1 Thermistor  
x1 Photo Resistor  
x2 10K Ohm Resistor  
x1 330 Ohm Resistor  
x2 LED (Any color)  
(At least 1 LED is required, use more LED to combine a color)
